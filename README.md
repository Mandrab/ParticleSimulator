# Results

Maybe try:<br/>
- exec collision calc without wait all the thread (when a thread come, analize it's balls)<br/>
- grid map check (is cheat?)<br/>
- start from another index during collision calc (may help with less processors)<br/>

## Conflict array + Synch vs Lock comparison


| bodies-step | Prof. seq version (1Th) | sync (13Th) | lock (13Th) | sync + C.A. (13Th) | lock + C.A. (13Th) |

## Bodies subdivision comparision

The new subdivision logic aim to distribute calcs more equally over simulators.
